To declare a data object at global scope, store it in a field or child of the global node. This global node may be accessed from the entire SceneGraph application.

To access the global node in components, use the predefined m.global, much like m.top.

For access to the global node from non-component script as in source/main.brs, use getGlobalNode() called on the roSGScreen object.

In non-component script, where the global node is obtained using getGlobalNode(), you can store it in m.global so that the syntax for subsequent references to it matches that for components.
